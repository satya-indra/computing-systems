## 1. **Stream Basics**

### Key Concepts
- **Introduction to Streams**  
  Understand what a stream is, its key features (lazy evaluation, non-storage of data), and how it supports functional-style operations.
- **Creating Streams**
  - **From Collections:**
    - **List:** `List.stream()`
    - **Map:**
      - `Map.keySet().stream()`
      - `Map.entrySet().stream()`
    - **Set:** Directly stream from a set.
  - **From Arrays:**
    - **Primitive Arrays:**
      - `Arrays.stream(intArray)` (e.g., for `int[]`, `double[]`)
      - **Pros:** No boxing overhead and includes specialized operations like `sum()`, `average()`.
      - **Cons:** For object arrays, converting to a primitive stream isn’t directly applicable.
    - **Object Arrays:**
      - `Stream.of(array)` (e.g., for `Integer[]`).
  - **From Functions:**
    - `Stream.generate()` for infinite streams using a Supplier.
    - `Stream.iterate()` for creating sequences based on custom rules.
    - `StreamSupport.stream()` and `Stream.Builder` for advanced scenarios.
- **Understanding the Stream Pipeline**  
  Learn the stages: Source → Intermediate Operations → Terminal Operations.

### Practice Problems
1. Create a stream from a list of integers and filter out numbers greater than a given value.
2. Convert an array of strings to a stream and transform them to uppercase.
3. Build a stream from a map’s keys and print each key.
4. Use `Arrays.stream()` to create an `IntStream` and calculate the sum of its elements.
5. Use `Stream.of()` to create a stream from an array of objects and print each element.
6. Generate an infinite stream of random numbers using `Stream.generate()` and limit it to 10 elements.
7. Create a stream using `Stream.iterate()` to generate the first 10 multiples of 5.
8. Demonstrate the difference between lazy evaluation by inserting a debugging print statement in an intermediate operation.
9. Combine two different streams (from a list and an array) using `Stream.concat()`.
10. Explain why a stream cannot be reused after a terminal operation by writing sample code that attempts to do so.

### Interview Questions
- What are the key differences between streams and collections in Java?
- How does lazy evaluation work in streams?
- Can you explain the stream pipeline and the roles of intermediate vs. terminal operations?
- How would you generate an infinite stream and what precautions must you take?
- What happens if you try to reuse a stream after a terminal operation?

## 2. **Intermediate Operations**

### Key Concepts
- **Filtering (`filter()`):**  
  Remove unwanted elements based on a predicate.
- **Mapping (`map()`):**  
  Transform each element of a stream into another form.
- **Flat Mapping (`flatMap()`):**  
  Flatten nested structures (e.g., a stream of lists) into a single stream.
- **Sorting (`sorted()`):**  
  Order the stream’s elements naturally or via custom comparators.
- **Distinct (`distinct()`):**  
  Remove duplicate elements.
- **Limit & Skip:**
  - `limit()` to truncate the stream.
  - `skip()` to bypass a specified number of elements.

### Practice Problems
1. Filter a list of integers to only include even numbers.
2. Map a list of strings to their lengths.
3. Convert a stream of integers to their squares.
4. Use `flatMap()` to flatten a list of lists into one list.
5. Use `flatMap()` to flatten a n level nested lists into one list.
6. Sort a list of strings in natural order and then in reverse order.
7. Remove duplicates from a stream of random integers using `distinct()`.
8. Skip the first 3 elements of a stream and collect the next 7.
9. Chain `filter()`, `map()`, and `sorted()` to transform and order a list of custom objects.
10. Demonstrate the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` with nested collections.
11. Combine filtering and mapping operations to extract and process specific fields from a stream of objects.

### Interview Questions
- What is the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` in streams?
- How would you sort a stream of custom objects?
  - Using comparator ? 
- In what scenarios might `distinct()` not behave as expected?
  - when hashcode and equals method are not proper.
  - when stream is modified after calling distinct.
  - In parellel streams, elements might be processed in different threads, other threads may not know the presence of same object in other threads.
  - In complex nested objects, as equals method checks only top level object.
- Can you explain how `limit()` and `skip()` work in a stream pipeline?
  - Help in slicing the stream. Use limit(n) for performance when working with large or infinite streams. Use skip(n) carefully, as skipping too many elements can lead to an empty stream. 
- Stream best practises ? How does chaining multiple intermediate operations affect stream processing?
  - Streams are lazy, meaning intermediate operations don’t execute immediately. They are only evaluated when a terminal operation is called.
  - Elements flow through the pipeline one-by-one, not in batches. This means each element is processed through all intermediate steps before moving to the next element.
  - Some operations can stop processing early (short-circuiting). This helps improve performance. Ex: findFirst() etc.
  - Expensive operations should be placed later in the pipeline to minimize processing. Example: Filtering first is better than sorting first.
  - Stream operations are fused, meaning the list is not processed multiple times. This reduces memory overhead and improves efficiency.
  - If you use .parallelStream(), elements may not be processed in order. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using ordered operations like sorted().

## 3. **Terminal Operations**

### Key Concepts

- **Collect:**  
  Converting streams into collections or other data structures using collectors.
- **Reduce:**  
  Aggregating stream elements into a single result.
- **ToArray:**  
  Converting a stream to an array.
- **Matching Operations:**
  - `anyMatch()`
  - `allMatch()`
  - `noneMatch()`
- **Find Operations:**
  - `findFirst()`
  - `findAny()`

### Practice Problems
1. Print each element of a stream using `forEach()`.
2. Collect a stream of strings into a `List` and a `Set`.
3. Use `reduce()` to calculate the product of all elements in a stream.
4. Convert a stream of integers into an array using `toArray()`.
5. Find the first element in a stream that meets a condition using `findFirst()`.
6. Check if all elements in a stream are positive using `allMatch()`.
